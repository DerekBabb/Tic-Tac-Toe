# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is the Tic-Tac-Toe AI project for my AP Computer Science course.

Students should begin by looking at the ExampleAI.java file.  This will provide a reference for how their AI will play.
The ExampleAI is totally random in its play.

Their AI will extend a PlayerTTT class and must have a play method that takes in an array of characters for the gameboard.
The play ends when the player returns the spot (0-8) where they would like to play.

To play the game, add the new AI to the Setup.java by extending the array of PlayerTTT objects and instantiating your class.

Once Setup.java is updated, run the TicTacToe.java.  All the players will be in the pull-down menus and games can be simulated from 1 - 10,000.
